# Projects in python
## Discord Bot
The bot started off as a pokedex (a list of all pokemon) for a discord server of three people. You would give the bot a number range and it would give you back the pokemon IDs within that range.

It was a simple idea and it worked well enough for us. We quickly grew bored of the pokemon and I started adding commands that would send back gifs and images and text/emojis for our inside jokes. One way to describe it would be a filing cabinet of memes. I added a scoring/currency system `Ponks` which we could trade with one another and we could see how many we saved up with the leaderboard.

Every gif-producing command would cost a certain amount of `Ponks` and the bot would receive them in a transaction. We needed a way to get the currency back so I added a Pinata event that would trigger once the bot had reach a certain amount. It required all members to use the `.smack` command, dropping a random percentage of `Ponks` on the ground with every wave of smacks.

Other features of the bot include:
- Note system
  - Add a note to the system
  - Ask the bot to pick a random note
  - Purge (snap) half the notes
- Oxford Dictionary API
  - Ask the bot to define a word
- Minecraft Server Status API
  - Show all online players on a certain server
- Maps of the world
  - Ask the bot to show a map of a country or region
- Random Emoji
  - Ask the bot to pick up to 10 random emojis
- Flip a coin
- Roll a dice
- Guess a number between 1 and 100 for the chance to win `Ponks`
- Slap each other to make them drop some `Ponks`
- Insert your own character into a copypasta
- Various gifs and video links

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
